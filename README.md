# OmniFresh
In this project I worked with three great colleagues that I met during the Hackathon.
We decided to try to solve the Hello Fresh challenge.
For this we built an IOS app that elevates the culinary experience by tailoring recipes to each user's unique tastes, dietary restrictions, lifestyle preferences and cooking skills.

My part in this project was in the Back-End and Database, designing the database based on the most important features given by the Hello Fresh team, coding the Machine Learning algorithm for the database recommendations, as well as creating the API to write the database in the Appwrite platform in order to make the app work together with Swift.

Even though we were not able to finish the project, I feel very proud and grateful to my teammates and I for the effort we put in.
